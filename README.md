# Data-Science-Karaoke

Data Science Karaoke is based on the idea of Powerpoint Karaoke where purposfully "awful" presentations are presented withut seeing the slide contents beforehand. This version is geared towards an audience that is familiar with basic statistics and machine learning methods.

Expected duration: ca. 15min per presentation (total 1h)

## Rules

- Team up in 4 teams (2-3 people is ideal but in general more people --> more fun)
- Each team must present their part for 5 minutes minimum (more is fine) without seeing the presentation beforhand and acting as if they created it themselves
- There is a 2 minute Q&A after each presentation
- Have fun!

## -- Do not look at the slides beforehand to preserve the fun --
